Hi! there I am Prajit Shandilya, the developer of Destiny. I am 14 years old and I study in Dav Public School Sasaram.
I learn programming and I designed Destiny only for practicing my concepts. But I keep on working Destiny day by day and made it a full ai assistant.
I also designed the GUI for her.
Destiny can do certain functions in your system .....if you want more, you have to update(programme) her.
That's all about me. Thank You Guys!
